      <p>In November I was laid off from Netflix, a company I had been with for the past seven years.  I planned to take a month off for vacation but due to unforseen events I was unable to get myself back into the workforce until Feburary.  It was a temp job: wiring control panels for a local automation company.  There was no hope of advancement but it was really just a placeholder; I had another oppurtunity on the back-burner...</p>
      <p>In December I contacted my cousin in Kansas City to see if she knew of any jobs out that way.  She informed me that her husband's family owned a flooring company in the state and had a few offices here in town.  I got some contact info and was off to find a job.</p>
      <p>I met with a man named John Reinhold, the VP of operations here in STL.  He said that with my background they would love to bring me on and that he just needed to find an opening.  We agreed to keep in touch and I was off to find some temp work to occupy my time until we got something worked out.</p>
      <p>I found the temp job wiring automation and waited to hear back from John.  Opportunities arose in KC...too far, not the right time, "we'll keep looking"...  Then two weeks ago a spot opened up in the main warehouse in St. Charles.  Entry-level, but it's a way to learn to company before taking on something with my responsibility.  Plan is to work under the GM for a few months before moving on to another warehouse.  Pays well, sounds great.</p>
